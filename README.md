# Calculator


The "Simple Calculator" is a compact and easy-to-understand program written in the C programming language. This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input. It offers a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to interact with the program in a straightforward manner.
## Key Features

User Interaction: The program prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numeric values. This intuitive interaction allows users to specify the mathematical operation they want to perform.

Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations, ensuring that users can perform a wide range of mathematical calculations.

Error Handling: To enhance the user experience, the program includes error-handling mechanisms. It prevents division by zero and informs the user when an invalid operator is entered, providing clear and concise error messages.

Precision: Results are displayed with a precision of two decimal places, ensuring that the output is easily readable and accurate.

Versatility: While it offers basic functionality, this code serves as a foundational example for those learning C programming. It can be extended and modified to include more complex operations or integrated into larger applications as needed.
